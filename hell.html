	<p>Tubo lives in a place simply referred to as the puddle. The story behind it goes a little something like this:</p>
    </div>

	<div class="wrld2">
      <p>"During the earliest creation, there were two celestial beings, named Niro and Hiro, who roamed over the empty universe. The two were close, some would even say lovers, but as the timeless days moved on, they became lonely. They began creating many creatures to have others to share their company with. But no matter how much land, plants, and animals, there was still something missing. Niro then decided to create a new being, one capable of consciousness and speech. This was when 'humans' were created. Inspired by this new being, Hiro created something similar. However, these creatures were far from human. With grotusque features and inhuman looks, these begins terrorized the early humans. Frightened by them, the humans asked their creator to get rid of them. So, Niro separated the humans and monsters, splitting the Earth into two parts.  Feeling insulted by this, Hiro cursed some of the humans to become the monsters they feared so much. This later caused a war to break out between the two races. Niro loved his creations, as it no longer felt lonely. Fearful of the complete annihilation of its new companions, Niro decided to sacrifice himself and banished Hiro along with his creations to a mirror realm simply known as the puddle. The name came from the entry way that connects the two realms, looking nothing more than a normal rain puddle. Centuries have passed since this time in history and the war has long been forgotten. But that hasn't stopped each species from being weary of one another."</p>

     <div class="wrld3">
      <p>The puddle is separated into 5 layers (or Districts as they're called), each District having different looks and cultures. Tubo lives in what's referred to as District 1. A crowded and noisy city similar to what's known on earth. The buildings resemble normal apartment buildings but they're squished and mounted on top of each other. With many vendors, unmarked stores, and abandoned buildings littering the small streets. With the sky being a dark purple and the building's using similar dark bricks, District 1 can come off as a gloomy place for first time visitors. But it's far from it. Many of the residents are close to one another, in both a spiritual and physical sense. It's common for someone to know someone who knows someone, each resident living in a very communal sense. Due to how talkative and close everyone is, it makes sense for someone like Tubo to call this place home.</p>
