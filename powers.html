	<p>Tubo has a very unique ability. Well unique in the sense that it's rare for a monster to have his powers. Most monsters in the puddle can use magic. However, it's very limited and hard to use. They can perform simple tasks, like lifting small objects, creating small fires and many other simple feats. Many of the monsters created devices that amplify the magic for daily uses, like stoves and stuff. The only monsters able to use more complex magic are some in District 4 and the being Hiro itself. Now what makes Tubo different is his power doesn't come from magic available in the puddle. Everything about his ability is purely physical in a sense. Due to this, his power doesn't have a specific limit like most. His abilities allow him, when in a heightened state of emotions (intense anger, sadness, etc) he will grow in strength. His body will expand two times his normal mass and he will look more feral. In this state, his mind becomes clouded and he acts more animalistic. It can be hard to pull him from this state as it is stated by him that the transformation is very painful, which only upsets him more and causes him to grow even more. Because of this, Tubo tends to live a very zen life. He is very hard to upset and tries his best to keep his anger under control. As of now only 3 recorded incidents have happened so far. He's such a good boy :)</p>
