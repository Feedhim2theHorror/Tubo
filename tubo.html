     	<p>Tubo is a monster of sorts. With the top half looking like a normal human but the bottom resembling that of a lion. He is really big, in both size and personality. He can come off as intimidating simply by his looks alone. But once you speak to him, he is very kind.  Loud and boisterous, Tubo is well liked by many of the residents within the puddle. He spends most of his time working in the children's home with his adoptive mother, enjoying his time by messing with the kids that live there. Despite his popularity, some find Tubo to be quite annoying. He isn't very smart and can let even the simplest of things fly over his head. But it's hard to hate such a loveable goof.</p>
